<section class="info">
<h3>Venti</h3>
<p>A bard that seems to have arrived on some unknown wind - sometimes sings songs as old as
 the hills, and<br> other times sings poems fresh and new. Likes apples and lively places
 but is not a fan of cheese or anything<br> sticky. When using his Anemo power to control
the wind, it often appears as feathers, as he's fond of that<br> which appears light and
breezy.<br>
Venti has a somewhat recalcitrant, carefree, and playful attitude as well as a liking 
to rhyming in his speech.<br> He sees a particular worth in music to the point where he 
names his lyre, saying, "every being deserves a<br> name to be called upon, and woven into
 a song." He is also bold, not fearing to insult or ignore those who <br>are supposedly 
 powerful.</p><br><br>
<h3>Klee</h3>
<p>Knights of Favonius Spark Knight! Forever with a bang and a flash! â€”And then
 disappearing from the stern<br> gaze of Acting Grand Master Jean. Sure, time in solitary
confinement gives lots of time to think about new<br> gunpowder formulas...But it'd still
be better to not be in solitary in the first place.<br>
Klee is an energetic and outgoing girl who takes after her mother, Alice. She has a 
particular talent for creating<br> explosives and is not fazed by the sound of explosions.
 She adores anything that can blow up like her bombs,<br> such as Amber's Baron Bunny. She
acts like a typical energetic young child who loves playing with her friends.<br>
Unfortunately, her definition of playing usually involves explosives; she is
particularly fond of "fish blasting",<br> tossing bombs into lakes full of fish.</p><br><br>
<h3>Tartaglia</h3>
<p>Meet Tartaglia  the cunning Snezhnayan whose unpredictable personality keeps people 
guessing his every move.<br>
Don't be under any illusion as to what he might be thinking or what his intentions are.
 Just remember this:<br> Behind that innocent, childlike exterior lies a finely honed 
instrument of war.<br>
As a young child Tartaglia was frightened and hesitant, but he secretly desired to become an
 adventurer like <br>the ones his father told him about as they fished together. After falling 
 into The Abyss and meeting and training<br> with Skirk, Tartaglia's personality drastically 
changed.<br>
While he appears to relatively friendly on the surface, Tartaglia is a bloodthirsty warrior.
 The Abyss and his old<br> master, Skirk, made him self-confident, solipsistic, and brash, 
 thriving on the sensation of being alive.<br> A warrior at heart, he constantly seeks ways to
  grow stronger, regardless of how he obtains said power.</p><br><br>
  <h3>Zhongli</h3>
<p>Wangsheng Funeral Parlor's mysterious consultant. Handsome, elegant, and surpassingly learned.
Though no one<br> knows where Zhongli is from, he is a master of courtesy and rules. From his seat at
 Wangsheng Funeral Parlor,<br> he performs all manner of rituals.<br>
 Zhongli is a calm, reserved, and polite man who knows much about Liyue's history and culture in 
 part due to his time<br> as the Geo Archon; like Venti, he has many experiences and memories, as
 he was a god well before The Seven even<br> existed. He holds very philosophical ideas towards
  money and has great respect for Liyue's traditions, including those<br> that have been forgotten
   or warped over time. Despite his wealth of information, Zhongli tends to be humble and even<br>
    seems somewhat insecure about it, being worried he comes off as a "bourgeois parasite".<br><br>
<h3>Ganyu</h3>
<p>The secretary to the Liyue Qixing. The blood of both human and illuminated beast flows within her veins.
Graceful <br>and quiet by nature, yet the gentle disposition of qilin sees not even the slightest conflict 
with even the most arduous<br> of workloads.
After all, Ganyu firmly believes that all the work she does is in honor of her contract with Rex 
Lapis,<br> seeking the well-being of all living things within Liyue.<br>
Ganyu is usually very quiet and reserved due to her half-qilin heritage. Qilin are also vegetarians;
 as such, she will not<br> eat any meat dishes, including vegetarian ones that have been fried in 
 animal fat. Both Xiangling and her father note <br> that whenever she visits Wanmin Restaurant, 
 she always eats in small quantities. She also completes whatever is given<br> to her, whether
  it be tasks or food, even if she is reluctant to do so.</p> <br><br>
  <h3>Hu tao</h3>
 <p>Hu Tao is the 77th Director of the Wangsheng Funeral Parlor, a person vital to managing Liyue's
 funerary affairs.She<br> does her utmost to flawlessly carry out a person's last rites and preserv
 the world's balance of yin and yang. Aside from<br> this, she is also a talented poet whose many 
 "masterpieces" have passed around Liyue's populace by word of mouth.<br>
Hu Tao enjoys pranking people and despises sitting around and doing nothing, as she wishes to
live her life to the fullest.<br> Her eccentric and off-the-wall personality often leaves people
with a negative impression of her, especially Qiqi, who<br> states that she has a "punchable face"
and should be stored in the fridge. In contrast, Xiao likes her humor, finding it<br> 
irritating but interesting.</p>
